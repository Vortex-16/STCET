## 🔢 **Format Specifiers**
Format specifiers are used in C programming to control the input and output format. They are essential for formatting data in `printf` and `scanf` functions. Today, we covered the following format specifiers:

| Format Specifier | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `%d` | Integer (int) |
| `%f` | Floating-point number |
| `%c` | Character |
| `%s` | String |
| `%x` | Hexadecimal representation |
| `%o` | Octal representation |
| `%lf` | Double |
| `%%` | Percent symbol (%) |
| `%u` | Unsigned decimal integer (unsigned int) |

---

## 💻 **Example Code**
Here’s an example of how to use format specifiers in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char c = 'a';
    int x = -1;
    float f = 7.9;
    double d = 777.898989;
    printf("Formatted output: %c %d %u %o %x %f %lf\n", c, x, x, x, x, f, d);
    return 0;
}
```
